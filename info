1. why make sculptors?
freeze the beautiful moments of life. the oldest form of art and most lasting.
cavemen made sculptors (carved on cave wall) so we know who things were like back then
they humanize public places. lea brought new elements to sculptors: benches (she originated, bringing a new trend to the art world).
lea wants ppl to touch and feel the art (sit on benches, kids play on it). inscription messsages into the benches. give ppl a chance to be part of art and immortal. lea is like a bronze archivist, not only artist.

bench: circle of life (born/die on a bed, rest, think etc)

da vinci note on making bronze




The key to understanding any people is in its art: its writing, painting, sculpture.” 
― Louis L'Amour, Education of a Wandering Man





The ultimate goal of the sculptor is to capture the essence of the figure, that person's individual message, through the pose that comes from within. 
(Robert G. Breur)





The scupltor does not work for the anatomist, but for the common observer of life and nature.
Bayard Ruskin Quotes , Source: True and Beautiful--Sculpture





All my life as an artist I have asked myself: What pushes me continually to make sculpture? I have found the answer. art is an action against death. It is a denial of death.
